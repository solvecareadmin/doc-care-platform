# Getting Started

**Care.Protocol** is not just a set of rules but a fundamental framework that governs how information is communicated in Care.Networks. It is an event-driven architecture design that contains a predefined structure in JSON files. These files define the configurations for roles, relationships, journeys, events, and interactions in a network.

In this guide, you will learn how to author Care.Protocol manually using the examples provided.

### Structure of files and folders

```
├── sample-network/
     ├── definitions/
     │    ├── card/
     │    ├── event/
     │    ├── event-handler/
     │    ├── python-event-handler/
     │    ├── resources/
     │    └── td/
     └── input.json 
```

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor to manually author files.
* The required Python packages to configure and run Python event handlers in Care.Protocol.
* Postman API platform and the network environment details for publishing.
* BrowserStack is a cloud web and mobile testing platform for testing the application.
