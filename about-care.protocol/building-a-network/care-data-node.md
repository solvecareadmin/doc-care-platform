# Care Data Node

### How Care Data Node works?

Care Data Node stores and exchanges data files in a Care.Network. It can convert external data files into events and conversely convert events into external data files. For incoming data files, Care Data Node extracts and transforms the data, and then generates the events. Event handlers can be authored in Care.Protocol to handle the events generated by Care Data Node.

### Data definition files&#x20;

The data definition file contains the model and structure for organizing data in Care Data Node.
