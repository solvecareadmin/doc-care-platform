# Introduction

## What is Care.Platform?

Care.Platform is a secure and decentralized ecosystem that allows individuals to take control of their data using blockchain-powered technologies. It is designed to reduce reliance on centralized IT systems and provides a foundation for Web3 development.

## **Key Components**
