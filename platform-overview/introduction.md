# Introduction

### What is Care.Platform?

**Care.Platform** is an ecosystem of healthcare solutions, built on blockchain, that aims to bridge the gaps in clinical care operations at a global scale. It reduces IT infrastructure costs while ensuring data security and regulatory compliance in healthcare.

With Care.Platform, you can build care networks to streamline the process and delivery of healthcare services. A care network connects various healthcare roles using decentralized applications, also known as **Care.Cards**, which can be accessed using **Care.Wallet**.

**Care.Wallet** is a personal healthcare assistant that helps manage your healthcare needs from your mobile device. It contains interactions in a healthcare journey, such as handling health records, booking appointments, and processing claims or payments.

### Use Case Examples

#### Remote patient monitoring

The care provider does not directly administer treatment in remote patient monitoring systems. The system facilitates treatment adjustments and supports the patient in managing their condition.

#### Insurance claims processing

In most cases, the healthcare provider handles submitting the insurance claim on behalf of the patient. For reimbursement plans, such as vision or dental insurance, the patient may be required to pay upfront and then submit a claim to get reimbursed.

#### Employee rewards system

Healthcare employees work long hours and often face stressful situations. To avoid burnout and high turnover, health organizations can implement a rewards system for their employees. This system can include gift cards, paid time offs, discount vouchers, wellness programs, and more.
