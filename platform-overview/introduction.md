# Introduction

## What is Care.Platform?

**Care.Platform** is an ecosystem of healthcare solutions built on blockchain technology. It is designed to bridge gaps in clinical operations globally by reducing IT infrastructure costs while ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.

## **Key Components**

**Care.Network** is a digital network of various healthcare roles, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other care providers. The network is built to provide personalized healthcare services to its members. Each Care.Network operates based on a specific set of rules defined in a Care.Protocol.&#x20;

**Care.Protocol** is the governance framework that establishes the rules for data exchange and communication within a Care.Network. Additionally, it can also be configured to ensure interoperability between Care.Networks and Care.Wallet.

**Care.Wallet** is a mobile application that functions as a personal healthcare assistant. It manages various aspects of a user's healthcare journey, including health record storage, appointment booking, and payment processing.&#x20;

## Use Case Examples

### Remote patient monitoring

The care provider does not directly administer treatment in remote patient monitoring systems. The system facilitates treatment adjustments and supports the patient in managing their condition.

### Insurance claims processing

In most cases, the healthcare provider handles submitting the insurance claim on behalf of the patient. For reimbursement plans, such as vision or dental insurance, the patient may be required to pay upfront and then submit a claim to get reimbursed.

### Employee rewards system

Healthcare employees work long hours and often face stressful situations. To avoid burnout and high turnover, health organizations can implement a rewards system for their employees. This system can include gift cards, paid time offs, discount vouchers, wellness programs, and more.
