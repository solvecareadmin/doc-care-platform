# User Profile

The Profile screen allows users to view the details they have saved in the application. The following information is displayed:

1. Wallet ID
2. Nickname
3. Country
4. Verification method
5. Financial information

The information is clearly labeled so users understand which details are public, private, or shared only with us. Users can update their nickname and financial information; however, other details cannot be changed.

Users can also view detailed descriptions of each field and learn how their data is being securely stored.

Additionally, users have the option to delete their wallet account if they no longer wish to use the service.

To open the profile screen, tap 'Profile' from the bottom navigation bar.\
