# Test and Publish

### Deployment readiness checklist

Before testing and publishing the network, make sure that:

* [ ] All files and data are correctly referenced in the `input.json` file.
* [ ] There are no logical errors in the referenced data.
* [ ] The `/definitions` folder and `input.json` file are packaged into one zip file.
* [ ] The DDF and CSV files are ready for upload.
* [ ] You have the test environment details where you want to publish the protocol. For more information, see [Publishing the protocol](publishing-the-protocol.md).
