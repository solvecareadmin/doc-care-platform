# Care Data Node

## How Care Data Node works?

The Care Data Node (CDN) is responsible for storing and exchanging data files within the Care.Network. It has the ability to convert external data files into events, and events into external data files. When receiving data files, the Care Data Node extracts and transforms the data, and then creates events. Event handlers can be created in Care.Protocol to manage the events generated by the Care Data Node.

## Data definition file

The data definition file (DDF) contains the model and structure for organizing data in CDN. This file is used in CDN to process incoming data files and generate events for distribution to Care.Nodes. The DDF and raw CSV files are uploaded to the environment repository for processing with CDN. For more information, see [Updating CDN](../test-and-publish/publishing-the-protocol.md#update-cdn).
